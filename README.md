![work](https://github.com/marcosrjjunior/bun-shell-min-timer/blob/main/assets/work-output.png?raw=true)

After setting the builded file to my .zshrc I can now just run:

```sh
// timer [work|rest] &
timer work &
timer rest &
```

Or I can set a custom time for each one of the actions:

```sh
timer work 10 &
timer rest 10 &
```

#### How to contribute

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun index.ts work
bun index.ts rest
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.26. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
